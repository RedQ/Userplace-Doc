# Registration Settings:

By default WordPress disables the registration process in the site. You should enable this feature if you want to allow user's registration. If this settings is not enabled, then our shortcode **\[userplace\_**_**register**_**\_form\] **won't work, and users will not be able to  register into your website.

By default in the register page along with our shortcode, users will see something like the screenshot below. Registering new users is currently not allowed. But don't be afraid, you can enable it any time with clicking the simple checkbox.

In the WordPress admin panel there is a Settings Menu. Click the **Settings&gt;General **There is a label called **Membership** and on the right side of it there is a checkbox labeled with **Anyone can register**. Click the checkbox icon and click save. Now your users can see the registration form and they can join your site at any time.
