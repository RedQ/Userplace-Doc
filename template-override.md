# Template Override

We tried to add highest flexibility in our Userplace plugin. Most of the user's want to use plugin with custom made theme. Some also want to change the default plugin design and behavior of the plugin. So we bring to you the template override system. Also we have as many as apply filters and action hooks  possible. So you can make any kind of addons too.

For template overriding just make a directory named **userplace **inside your theme root folder.

Check the **userplace/templates** folder inside of it, you should use the same folder and and file name. Copy any files or folders form the plugin and paste it in your theme folders. You can now change the template form there.

E.g. If your want to change the register page design then copy the **shortcode/register\_form.php** into your theme folder and then edit.
